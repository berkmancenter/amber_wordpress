Amber WordPress plugin
=================
Amber keeps links working on blogs and websites.

Whether links fail because of DDoS attacks, censorship, or just plain old link rot, reliably accessing linked content is a problem for Internet users everywhere. The more routes we provide to information, the more all people can freely share that information, even in the face of filtering or blockages. Amber adds to these routes.
